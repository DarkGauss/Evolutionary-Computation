Projects from Evolutionary Computation course at the University of Idaho

## Project 1 - 8 Queens Problem
Analysis of two different genetic algorithms being used to solve the 8-Queens problem, one using a permutation to represent the chess board, and the other using a set. The algorithm using the permutation converged on a correct solution the fastest.

## Project 2 - Island Model
Using an Island model and a Genetic Algrithom to solve the 6 standard test functions.

## Project 3 - Symbolic Regression
Performance comparison of using a steady state algorithm vs a genetic algorithm to a evolve a genetic program to mimic the output of a test function.

## Project 4 - Breast Cancer Recognition
Using Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programs as Classifiers
on Real-World Data.
